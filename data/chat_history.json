It startled all in attendance with its central insight nothing less than countercultural in a world still recovering from its first great war and already hurtling toward another: that \u201ccivilization arises and unfolds in and as play.\u201d\n\nThis would become the backbone of Huizinga\u2019s visionary 1938 book Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture (public library). Animated by questions \u201chovering over spheres of thought barely accessible either to psychology or to philosophy,\u201d it went on to inspire everything from board games to mobile architecture to the magic circle concept of virtual worlds, and to influence generations of thinkers as sundry as Eric Berne (who cited Huizinga in his revolutionary 1964 book Games People Play), Richard Powers (who built the cathedral of his excellent novel Playground upon Huizinga\u2019s foundation), and Thomas Merton (who underlined passages on nearly every page of his copy).\n\n\nArt by Julie Paschkis from The Wordy Book\n\nWhile his Austrian contemporary Otto Rank was pleading for \u201cthe recognition and the acceptance of the irrational element as the most vital part of human life,\u201d Huizinga considers play \u2014 \u201ca well-defined quality of action which is different from \u2018ordinary\u2019 life\u201d \u2014 as evidence that our lives are animated by something beyond mind and beyond matter:\n\nThe incidence of play is not associated with any particular stage of civilization or view of the universe. Any thinking person can see at a glance that play is a thing on its own, even if his language possesses no general concept to express it. Play cannot be denied. You can deny, if you like, nearly all abstractions: justice, beauty, truth, goodness, mind, God. You can deny seriousness, but not play.\n\nBut in acknowledging play you acknowledge mind, for whatever else play is, it is not matter. Even in the animal world it bursts the bounds of the physically existent. From the point of view of a world wholly determined by the operation of blind forces, play would be altogether superfluous. Play only becomes possible, thinkable and understandable when an influx of mind breaks down the absolute determinism of the cosmos. The very existence of play continually confirms the supra-logical nature of the human situation. Animals play, so they must be more than merely mechanical things. We play and know that we play, so we must be more than merely rational beings, for play is irrational.\n\n\nArt by Remi Charlip from My Very Own Special Particular Private and Personal Cat by Sandol Stoddard\n\nThis may be why evolutionary theory \u2014 which is an explanatory framework based on reason: adaptation as cause and effect \u2014 has so far failed to explain why nature gave us play, as unnecessary and as hallowing as any act of grace:\n\nIn this intensity, this absorption, this power of maddening, lies the very essence, the primordial quality of play. Nature, so our reasoning mind tells us, could just as easily have given her children all those useful functions of discharging superabundant energy, of relaxing after exertion, of training for the demands of life, of compensating for unfulfilled longings, etc., in the form of purely mechanical exercises and reactions. But no, she gave us play, with its tension, its mirth, and its fun.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nPlay presents itself to us\u2026 as an intermezzo, an interlude in our daily lives. As a regularly recurring relaxation, however, it becomes the accompaniment, the complement, in fact an integral part of life in general. It adorns life, amplifies it and is to that extent a necessity both for the individual \u2014 as a life function \u2014 and for society by reason of the meaning it contains, its significance, its expressive value, its spiritual and social associations, in short, as a culture function.\n\n\nArt from Kenny\u2019s Window \u2014 Maurice Sendak\u2019s forgotten philosophical first children\u2019s book\n\nPlay is so compelling in part because it \u201clies outside the antithesis of wisdom and folly,\u201d free from the binaries of right and wrong that bind our ordinary lives. This is Huizinga\u2019s most daring axiom: While the traditional view holds that moral development \u2014 the annealing of our rights and wrongs \u2014 is how societies advance, he argues that play is the true sculptor of civilization:\n\nReal civilization cannot exist in the absence of a certain play-element, for civilization presupposes limitation and mastery of the self, the ability not to confuse its own tendencies with the ultimate and highest goal, but to understand that it is enclosed within certain bounds freely accepted. Civilization will, in a sense, always be played according to certain rules, and true civilization will always demand fair play. Fair play is nothing less than good faith expressed in play terms. Hence the cheat or the spoil-sport shatters civilization itself. To be a sound culture-creating force this play-element must be pure. It must not consist in the darkening or debasing of standards set up by reason, faith or humanity. It must not be a false seeming, a masking of political purposes behind the illusion of genuine play-forms. True play knows no propaganda; its aim is in itself, and its familiar spirit is happy inspiration.\n\n\nArt by Giuliano Cucco from Before I Grew Up by John Miller\n\nAnd yet for all this theorizing, Huizinga concedes that the role and riddle of play is a \u201cquestion that eludes and deludes us to the end, in a lasting silence.\u201d Nearly a century after him, Diane Ackerman turned that silence into song with her lyrical defense of \u201cdeep play\u201d as that vital \u201ccombination of clarity, wild enthusiasm, saturation in the moment, and wonder\u201d that makes life more alive.",

        "how to deal with toddlers who are misbehaving because of a new baby",
        "Dealing with a toddler's misbehavior after the arrival of a new baby can be challenging, as they may feel insecure or jealous about the changes in the family dynamic. Here are some strategies to help you manage this transition:\n\n### 1. **Acknowledge Their Feelings:**\n   - Validate your toddler's emotions by acknowledging that it\u2019s okay to feel upset, jealous, or confused. Use phrases like, \u201cI see you\u2019re feeling sad about the baby\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel upset when things change.\u201d\n\n### 2. **Maintain Routines:**\n   - Try to keep your toddler\u2019s routine as consistent as possible. Predictability can be comforting during a time of change.\n\n### 3. **Involve Them:**\n   - Include your toddler in caring for the new baby. Assign them small tasks, like bringing diapers or singing to the baby. This can help them feel included and important.\n\n### 4. **One-on-One Time:**\n   - Set aside special time just for your toddler, where they have your undivided attention. Engaging in activities they enjoy can help reinforce your bond and alleviate feelings of jealousy.\n\n### 5. **Positive Reinforcement:**\n   - Offer praise and positive reinforcement for good behavior. Recognize and reward moments when they exhibit kindness or patience.\n\n### 6. **Model Calm Behavior:**\n   - Stay calm and composed even when your toddler misbehaves. Modeling self-control can help them learn to cope with their feelings better.\n\n### 7. **Redirect Their Energy:**\n   - When misbehavior occurs, redirect your toddler\u2019s energy towards more appropriate activities, such as drawing, playing with toys, or reading books.\n\n### 8. **Set Clear Boundaries:**\n   - Establish clear and consistent rules for behavior. Make sure your toddler understands what is acceptable and what is not, and enforce consequences gently.\n\n### 9. **Speak to Them About the Baby:**\n   - Use age-appropriate language to explain the changes. Talk about the excitement of having a new baby and discuss how they can help.\n\n### 10. **Encourage Expression:**\n   - Provide outlets for expressing feelings. Simple art projects or play can help them articulate their emotions non-verbally.\n\n### 11. **Practice Patience:**\n   - Understand that this is a big life change for your toddler. It may take time for them to adjust, and occasional misbehavior is normal.\n\n### 12. **Seek Help if Needed:**\n   - If your toddler's behavior continues to be challenging, consider consulting a pediatrician or child psychologist for additional support and strategies.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can help your toddler adjust to the new family dynamic while managing their behavior effectively. Remember, it\u2019s a process, and it\u2019s okay to seek support along the way.",
